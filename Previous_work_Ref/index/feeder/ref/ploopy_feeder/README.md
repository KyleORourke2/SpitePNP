# The Ploopy Pick-And-Place Feeder

By some stroke of luck, you've made your way here. The Ploopy Pick-And-Place Feeder. Your life will never be the same.

This repository contains all of the design and production files necessary to make a Ploopy Pick-And-Place automated feeder, as well as its mating base plate. We've also included some kick-ass documentation in the Wiki on how to get it made and assemble it.

These feeders have been designed for use with standard 8mm paper and plastic tapes. This sort of tape usually accommodates things like 0603 resistors, 0805 capacitors, SOT-23 devices, and many more.

Check out a video of it in operation in a LitePlacer open-source pick-and-place machine [right here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa37CS5gLkE).

What are you waiting for? Your new life awaits.
